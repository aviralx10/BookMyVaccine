# APP DEMO <br>


# WHAT IT DOES<br>
We wanted to be apprehensive of the fact that the general masses are now getting vaccinated and we wanted to help more to this process. So we created BookMyVaccine.
The general features of this App are-
1. **BOOKING VACCINE SLOT** - With the medium of this App, Users can look for their nearest Hospitals, book the available time slots and select the type of vaccines they want and all this can be done with just a few clicks from this App.
2. **WIDGET** - We have incorporated Widgets too with the help of WidgetKit and we display the total number of people getting vaccinated in a specific country with the help of the widgets as we wanted to be optimistic of the fact that we are slowly defeating COVID-19.
